            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:197430:4"/> And yet under these pretences, there is great preparation of putting us in a posture of Defence, and a great necessity preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of setling the <hi>Miltia:</hi> But Wee see more cause to feare the remedy, then the disease; For this posture (as you call it) of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence doth carry a face of War with it, even amongst our selves and concerning it we are distracted with contrary commands; the Houses of Parliament command one thing, the King forbids that command; the King commands, and the Houses of Parliament for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids that command, and we are at a stand, and yet wee are ever ready to yeeld obedience to all the knowe Laws of the Land: and we have ever been taught, That all those Lawes made in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, consist of three Estates, the Commons, Lords, and King, and wee thinke it dangerous to untwist that triple Cord; and wee hold it our greatest Priviledge. That the King and Lords, whom we have heard sometime joyned in Counsell, could not make a Law to binde us without our consent in Parliament; and by the same reason, we cannot expect that the Commons, with the Lords, should make a Law or an Ordinance, of the force of a Law, to binde without the King, especially against the King. And as we doe no yeeld any Act of Obedience to the King's Command simply, but as it is warranted by Law, made by His Authority, with the Consent of both Houses; so we shall not conceive our selves bound to obey one or both Houses without the King, but in such things as are according to the known Lawes of the Land. When the King by his Writte gave us power to chuse you, it was to treate <hi>De quibusdam arduis, &amp;c.</hi> Wee nexe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> conceived your only Votes should bee our Law, nor conceived Wee had such a power to conferre upon you: And Wee require you not to consent to lay any such command upon us, nor to ingage us in any Civill war for the maintenance of such Votes, under colour of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riviledges against our lawfull King, to whom many of us, by the appointment of the Law, have taken the Oath of supremacy, and Alleg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:197430:4"/> lives and fortunes. And we conceive our best directions therein to be the knowne Lawes, the maintenance whereof wee account our onely liberty and defence. And we account the surest way to enjoy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of these Lawes, is to joyne and comply with his Majesty, under whose protection, next under God, wee can onely hope to enjoy the benefit thereof; especially his Majesty having ever since this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment joyned in the making of as good Lawes as ever any King hath done; and made so gracious promises of his future Government accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes, and given aboundant satisfaction for some unhappy accidents in his past Government, that we conceive great cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne him cheerefull thankfulnesse for these Lawes, and to yeeld a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience, and to confide in him for the future. This is the cleare expression of our hearts; this is that we desire you to consent in for us. And we shall heartily pray, that we might be an example to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to make the like expressions: And then wee should not doubt but this would bring a right understanding betwixt the King and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and take away all feares and jealousies, and settle a firme peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us. We should gladly, with all humility, have petitioned your Honourable House, but still to this purpose. And we understand some Countries have done so, which hath bin displeasing unto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they contrary to sense; and we, perhaps through ignorance might fall into the same errour. Yet wee hope it will not be displeasing unto you, that we give you our sence freely, for you are us, and we hope you will not be unwilling to follow our sence, so far as you conceive it to be the sence of your County whose you are, and for whom you serve. And so we rest your very loving Friends and Country-men.</p>
